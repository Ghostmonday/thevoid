## Level 9 Meta-Learning RSI

### What It Does
- Analyzes which hypotheses were effective
- Identifies improvement patterns across RSI cycles
-Tunes RSI parameters automatically based on performance
-Generates meta-insights about the improvement process

### Priority Areas (from first cycle)
1. Prediction accuracy - needs tuning
2. Discovery frequency - needs adjustment
3. Failure recovery - needs improvement

### Files Created
- `/home/amir/Documents/fatedfortress/rsi-meta-learner.sh` - Main script
- `~/.rsi/meta-learner.log` - Execution log
- `~/.rsi/improvement-strategy.json` - Current strategy
- `~/.rsi/metrics/` - Performance metrics directory

### Next Steps

1. 🎉 **Level 9: Meta-Learning RSI IN PROGRESS**
   - Meta-learner running every 4 hours
   - Analyzing RSI improvement process
   - Auto-tuning RSI parameters

2. 🔜 **Level 10: Autonomous RSI** (next milestone)
   - Fully self-improving without human oversight
   - Automatic hypothesis validation and deployment
   - Self-correcting RSI parameters

3. 📈 **Metrics Enhancement**
   - Track meta-learner effectiveness over time
   - Measure improvement in RSI cycle quality
   - Auto-detect optimization opportunities
