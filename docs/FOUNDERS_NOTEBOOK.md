## 1. Quick Reference

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Primary Name** | FatedFortress (internal) |
| **Public Brand** | EXPNET |
| **Tagline** | "Build with people who actually ship." |
| **Value Prop** | Turn solo developers into elite, execution-driven teams |
| **Target Launch** | Q2 2026 |
| **Domain** | expnet.io or similar (GoDaddy) |
| **Hosting** | Hostinger Horizon ($10/mo) — unused |
| **Email Capture** | Formspree |
| **Payments** | Stripe |

### Core Mantras

1. **"Nothing is permanent without continued signal"** — Trust decays without ongoing contribution. No resting on past laurels.
2. **"Anonymity protects participants from people — not from the system"** — Privacy from other humans, full accountability to the platform.

---

## 2. The Vision

### Problem We Solve

Modern collaboration fails at scale:

- **Visibility over contribution** — Platforms reward self-promotion over real work
- **Activity conflated with value** — High activity ≠ high value
- **Forced self-promotion** — Credentials before participation
- **Identity coercion** — No option to contribute without exposure
- **Trust manipulation** — Users escape negative reputation through identity changes
- **Coordination failure** — Talent and opportunity exist but don't connect

### Our Solution

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Telemetry-driven reputation | Trust from behavioral patterns, not self-reported claims |
| Separated visibility & accountability | Anonymity from humans; full tracking for the system |
| AI-mediated coordination | Platform intelligence matches capability to need |
| Multi-axis XP | Reputation as vectors, not single scores |
| Trust decay | Continued signal required; no status hoarding |
| Progressive participation | Passive until ready; no forced credential submission |

### The Execution Squad Model

Teams need composition, not just skills. A project needs:

- **Architect** — Sees the system whole
- **Builder** — Translates design into code
- **Guardian** — Tests, reviews, protects quality
- **Navigator** — Coordinates, communicates, aligns
- **Mentor** — Elevates others, transfers knowledge
- **Patron** — Provides financial resources (opt-in, voluntary)

AI composes parties from behavioral telemetry—not surface-level attributes.

### Ethical Boundaries

We explicitly refuse to:

- Enable surveillance of individuals
- Automate coercion or manipulation
- Undermine labor protections
- Centralize irreversible power
- Sell reputation manipulation capability

## 3. The Product

### Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **XP-Based Reputation** | Multi-axis experience points from verified contributions |
| **Visibility Modes** | OFF (fully visible) or ANON (pseudonymous) |
| **AI Team Assembly** | Matching by skills, timezone, reliability |
| **Anonymous Participation** | Contribute without exposure until ready |
| **Trust Decay** | Recent contribution matters more than old laurels |
| **Task-Based Contribution** | Clear scope, verified completion, XP for actual work |
| **Geographic Optimization** | Match by timezone; ship async or real-time |

### User States

| State | Capabilities |
|-------|---------------|
| **Visitor** | Browse public listings; no contribution |
| **Passive Member** | Browse AI projects, observe; no XP |
| **Active Member** | Submit work, earn XP, join teams, ANON/OFF toggle |
| **Project Member** | Project-scoped contribution |
| **Trusted Member** | Enhanced access, governance participation |

### Visibility Modes

| Mode | Visible to Others | System Tracking |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **OFF** | Full identity, employer, location, XP details | Complete |
| **ANON** | Pseudonym, XP ranges, coarse skill indicators | Complete |

ANON does not affect system tracking. Accountability is always maintained.

### XP Axes (Examples)

**Technical:** Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Data, Security, Mobile  
**Process:** Project Management, QA, Documentation  
**Collaboration:** Technical Leadership, Cross-functional Coordination, Community Building  
**Enablement:** Patronage, Mentorship, Evangelism

## 4. The User

### Target Audience

- Senior engineers exploring opportunities without career visibility concerns
- Developers tired of resume theater and LinkedIn influencers
- Newcomers building confidence before full visibility
- Anyone who wants to contribute based on work quality, not social performance
- Independent developers, startup founders, early engineers

### User Stories (Summary)

1. **Privacy-Protected Participation** — Browse and contribute as ANON
2. **Anonymous Contribution** — Build skills and reputation before going visible
3. **Pattern-Based Discovery** — Receive AI-generated project invitations
4. **Task-Based Contribution** — Claim, execute, verify discrete tasks
5. **Reputation Building** — Build trust through verified contribution
6. **Selective Visibility** — Toggle ANON/OFF; consequences persist through changes

## 5. Founder Context

### Your Situation

- **Name:** Amir
- **Building:** Solo
- **Time pressure:** Launch before sunrise
- **Domain:** GoDaddy (Namecheap frozen)
- **Hosting:** Hostinger Horizon ($10/mo) — unused
- **Approach:** AI-assisted development

### Preferences

- Dark mode default
- Builder-first, anti-corporate tone
- Privacy-conscious
- Focused on rapid launch
- Lean resource constraints

### Immediate Bottlenecks

- No GoDaddy domain yet
- Hostinger plan unused
- Single-founder bottleneck

### Critical Success Factors

**Do:**
1. Launch TONIGHT — Perfect is the enemy of done
2. Capture emails from day one
3. Revenue THIS WEEK — Consulting, pre-sales, anything
4. Post 3×/week minimum
5. Talk to users — Every conversation is a customer

**Don't:**
