```
Generate a production-ready, dark-themed landing page for FatedFortress, an AI-native collaboration platform for developers.

## IDENTITY

**Name:** FatedFortress (pronounced "EXP-net")
**Tagline:** "Build with people who actually ship."
**Positioning:** Anti-resume, anti-LinkedIn, execution-first collaboration platform
**Core Value:** Trust through demonstrated contribution, not self-promotion

## CORE PRINCIPLES (Incorporate These)

Use these mantras naturally in the copy:

1. "Nothing is permanent without continued signal"
   → Trust decays without ongoing contribution. No resting on past laurels.

2. "Anonymity protects participants from people — not from the system"
   → Privacy from other humans, but full accountability to the platform.

## TARGET AUDIENCE

- Senior engineers exploring opportunities without career visibility concerns
- Developers tired of resume theater and LinkedIn influencers
- Newcomers building confidence before full visibility
- Anyone who wants to contribute based on work quality, not social performance

## VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS

**Color Palette:**
- Background: #0a0a0a (near black)
- Card Background: #1a1a1a (slightly lighter)
- Text Primary: #f0f0f0 (off-white)
- Text Secondary: #a0a0a0 (muted gray)
- Accent Gradient: Linear gradient from #00d4ff (cyan) to #7c3aed (purple)
- Error/Urgent: #ff6b6b (soft red)
- Success: #00cc88 (muted green)

**Typography:**
- Headings: System sans-serif (Inter, -apple-system, Segoe UI), bold weights
- Body: System sans-serif, comfortable reading size (16px base)
- Monospace: For code/technical references only

**Design Language:**
- Clean, no clutter
- Subtle rounded corners (8-12px)
- Minimal borders, use subtle backgrounds for separation
- Smooth transitions on hover (0.2s ease)
- No gradients on backgrounds (only on accents/buttons)

## SECTION 1: HERO

**Headline:** "Stop Building Alone."

**Subheadline:** "Build with people who actually ship. No resumes. No LinkedIn theater. Just execution."

**Call to Action Buttons (side by side on desktop, stacked on mobile):**
- Primary Button: "Create Your Profile" → Gradient background (#00d4ff to #7c3aed), white text, hover: slight lift
- Secondary Button: "Get Early Access" → Transparent background, 1px solid #404040, white text, hover: border becomes #00d4ff

**Visual:** Clean, minimal. No stock photos of people shaking hands. Consider subtle abstract code or network visualization in muted tones.

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (3 Cards)

Card 1: "Resumes lie. Execution doesn't."
- Body: "Self-reported skills mean nothing. Real contribution tells the truth."

Card 2: "Building alone is slow."
- Body: "Great ideas die in isolation. The right team accelerates everything."

Card 3: "Identity theater is exhausting."
- Body: "Why perform for recruiters when you can just build?"

**Style:** 3-column grid on desktop, 1-column on mobile. Cards #1a1a1a background, subtle border.

## SECTION 3: HOW IT WORKS (3 Steps)

Step 1: "Create Your Profile"
- Icon: Simple user/plus icon
- Description: "Build your XP through verified contribution. No résumé required."

Step 2: "Join or Start a Project"
- Icon: Simple users/plus icon
- Description: "AI matches you with collaborators, or build your own team."

Step 3: "Ship Together"
- Icon: Simple rocket/checkmark icon
- Description: "Complete tasks, earn XP, build reputation. Together."

**Style:** Horizontal flow on desktop, vertical on mobile. Simple line connecting steps.

## SECTION 4: KEY FEATURES (6 Cards)

Arrange in 2x3 grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, 1-column on mobile:

1. **XP-Based Reputation**
   - "Your work speaks. Earn experience points through verified contributions. No self-promotion required."

2. **AI Team Assembly**
   - "Platform intelligence matches you with collaborators based on skills, timezone, and reliability—not who you know."

3. **Anonymous Participation**
   - "Senior engineers exploring? Newcomers building confidence? Contribute without exposure until you're ready."

4. **Trust That Matters**
   - "Trust decays without signal. What you've done recently matters more than what you did years ago."

5. **Task-Based Contribution**
   - "Clear scope. Verified completion. Earn XP for what you actually ship—not what you claim."

6. **Geographic Optimization**
   - "Match by timezone. Ship async. Find collaborators who work when you work."

## SECTION 5: THE SCHISM (New Section - 2 Columns)

**Headline:** "Know Who You're Building With"

**Left Column (For Veterans):**
"Spent 15 years mastering Rust? Shipped systems at scale?
Your expertise deserves respect. Curate teams of equals who share your standards."

**Right Column (For Everyone):"
New to this? Want to learn?
Find mentors, not gatekeepers. Build through contribution, not credentials."

**Style:** Two equal columns with subtle divider. #1a1a1a background for each column.
