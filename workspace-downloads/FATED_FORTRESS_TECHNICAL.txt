FATED FORTRESS — TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION (NON-COMPLETE EDITION)

Core Principles 1. Telemetry is append-only. 2. Identity is internally
verified. 3. External presentation may be anonymous. 4. AI proposes;
humans choose. 5. XP cannot be purchased.

Telemetry Architecture - Event logging per task lifecycle. - Immutable
contribution ledger. - Peer verification loop. - Weighted trust gradient
(execution, collaboration, contribution, judgment).

XP Model - Multi-axis scoring. - Time-weighted decay. - Skill-specific
decay rates. - Verification-weight multipliers.

Identity Layer - Verified real-world identity at registration. -
Optional public pseudonymity. - Smurf protection via backend linkage.

AI Layer - Suggests project formation. - Matches team archetypes
probabilistically. - Cannot override user consent. - Cannot directly
assign XP without verification consensus.

Governance - Audit trails immutable. - Appeals process defined. - Abuse
detection via anomaly analysis. - No pay-for-visibility mechanics.

Limitations - Does not measure wisdom. - Cannot guarantee personality
compatibility. - Matching remains probabilistic. - Telemetry captures
output, not intent.

This document defines structure. It does not claim transcendence.
