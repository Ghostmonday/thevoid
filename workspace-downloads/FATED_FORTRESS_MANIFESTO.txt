FATED FORTRESS — MANIFESTO

The Resume Is a Lie

The modern professional identity is curated fiction. Bullet points are
optimized narratives. LinkedIn is theater. Contribution graphs are
gamed. Titles are inflated.

We perform productivity. We simulate impact. We curate visibility.

Fated Fortress exists to end the performance.

Telemetry Is Signal

What you say about yourself is noise. What you do is signal.

The system captures: - Verified task execution - Code outcomes - Review
feedback loops - Time-distributed effort - Reliability under constraint

It does not capture: - Self-description - Social media narrative -
Vanity metrics

Telemetry is not engagement. Telemetry is contribution.

Nothing Is Permanent Without Continued Signal

Reputation is not a monument. It is a living system.

If skills evolve, reputation must evolve. If practice stops, signal
fades.

Decay is temporal accuracy.

XP Is Capability

XP is multi-dimensional. You are not Level 50. You are Level 40 in
backend architecture. Level 12 in distributed systems. Level 3 in
interface design.

XP is earned only through verified execution. Presence does not generate
value. Output does.
