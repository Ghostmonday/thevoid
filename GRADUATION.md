## Current Issues (Level 3/4 Test)

### Cron API Timeout
- **Detected**: 2026-02-11 19:19
- **Impact**: Direct cron API calls timeout after 60s
- **Workaround**: Direct file inspection of jobs.json works
- **Recovery Status**: ✅ retry-watcher should detect and retry
- **Files Verified**: jobs.json shows both jobs deployed correctly

### Self-Modify Workarounds Active
1. RSI jobs use `delivery.mode: "none"` to prevent delivery errors
2. Direct file inspection as fallback when API unavailable
3. Retry-watcher monitors for consecutive errors and auto-retries
4. rsi-job-manager.sh provides direct analysis and prediction capabilities
